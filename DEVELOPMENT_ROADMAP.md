# AIS Tracking Application - Development Roadmap

## Project Overview
AIS tracking application with real-time data processing, built for learning frameworks, CI/CD, and infrastructure.

**Tech Stack**: PostgreSQL, Node.js, React, Docker, GitHub Actions, Render

## Phase 1: Core AIS Integration âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Integration to Norway AIS stream (153.44.253.27:5631)
- [x] Parse and save AIS messages to database
- [x] Store ship information in database
- [x] Real-time message processing
- [x] Docker containerization
- [x] Comprehensive test suite
- [x] CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- [x] Render deployment configuration

### Technical Implementation Completed:
- AIS stream connection with auto-reconnection
- NMEA message parsing (types 1-3 for positions, type 5 for static data)
- PostgreSQL schema with ships, positions, and messages tables
- WebSocket real-time updates
- Health monitoring endpoints
- Error handling and logging

## Phase 2: Management Dashboard ðŸ”„ PLANNED
**Goal**: Health-check dashboard to monitor AIS connection and data flow

### Features to Implement:
- **Connection Status**: Visual indicator if AIS stream is connected
- **Real-time Metrics Dashboard**:
  - Number of ships currently being tracked
  - Position updates received in last X minutes/hours
  - Total messages processed
  - Connection uptime/downtime
- **Time-based Filtering**: Dropdown to view metrics for:
  - Last 5 minutes
  - Last 1 hour  
  - Last 24 hours
- **Health Alerts**: Notifications when connection drops or data stops flowing

### Technical Tasks:
- Create React dashboard components
- Implement WebSocket subscriptions for real-time updates
- Add metric aggregation queries
- Create responsive charts/graphs for metrics
- Add alerting system for health issues

## Phase 3: Interactive Map Dashboard ðŸ”„ PLANNED
**Goal**: Visual map showing ship positions with filtering capabilities

### Features to Implement:
- **Interactive Map**: Display ship positions at specific point in time
- **Time Selection**: Choose specific timestamp for position data
- **Ship Filtering**:
  - Filter by vessel type (cargo, tanker, passenger, etc.)
  - Filter by vessel length/dimensions
  - Filter by speed, course, or other characteristics
- **Ship Details**: Click on ship markers to view detailed information
- **Real-time Mode**: Toggle between historical and live tracking

### Technical Tasks:
- Integrate mapping library (Leaflet or Mapbox)
- Create ship marker components with vessel type icons
- Implement time-based position queries
- Add filtering UI components
- Create ship detail popups/panels
- Add real-time position updates on map

## Phase 4: TBD
*To be discussed based on phases 2-3 learnings*

## Development Notes
- Every change should include relevant test cases
- All commits should be deployable
- Good documentation for each feature
- CI/CD pipeline validates all changes
- Application runs locally via Docker

## Current Status
Phase 1 is complete and ready for GitHub repository setup and initial deployment to Render.

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Get application running locally
2. Set up GitHub repository
3. Configure Render deployment
4. Verify end-to-end functionality
5. Begin Phase 2 implementation
